# Manjaro Search

A set of Web Extensions that adds Manjaro (forum, packages, wiki, Arch Linux AUR) as a search engine to the Firefox browser
(using the [chrome_settings_overrides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides) manifest key).
Submits the query via GET request for compatibility with [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

## Install

- Install the extensions manually via AMO (**A**ddons **MO**zilla) following the links above

This is my First extension, adapted from https://github.com/noraj/firefox-extension-arch-search, so credit where credit is due. Probably not me.
